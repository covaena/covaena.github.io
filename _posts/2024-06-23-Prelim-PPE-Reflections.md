Two days ago, I sat my last prelim exam and finished my first year of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Oxford. Right now is the most competent I will ever be at all 3 simultaneously, as I will not continue studying Politics in my second and third years. But with the academic year seeming like quite literally _yesterday_, the wounds of exam week and three packed terms are still fresh – this all means that while the technical points I’ve made about the course are likely to be accurate, an emotional reflection of the time will probably mellow out with some time. Maybe I’ll revisit this post in the future.

I’ve had ideas to write something along these lines for a while; but it was only once I saw that [my friend had published his own version](https://rohanselvaradov.netlify.app/ppe/), that I found the serious motivation to set up this website and finally write this. That’s something I’ve really appreciated about PPE: the [inspirational coursemates](#people-reality).

Ultimately, this post is not a PPE essay, so I won’t formulaically weigh up positives and negatives to then shit out a dishonest ‘conclusion’ for the sake of arguing. Instead, I’ll first run through the course structure, recount my expectations when applying, reality check myself with a subject-by-subject review, a general coursework review, and finally reflect on whether I enjoyed my _time_ here, coursework or not.


## Course Structure

At Oxford, the academic year is split into three eight-week terms: Michaelmas (Oct-Dec), Hilary (Jan-Mar), and Trinity (Apr-Jun). PPE, like other Oxford undergraduate degrees, is a three-year course. The first year is called ‘Prelims’, where you study all three subjects. Most PPEists drop one of the three to focus on their other two subjects in their second and third years (called ‘FHS’, standing for ‘Final Honour School’).

Oxford and Cambridge are quite different to other universities in that administration is federated: ‘Oxford University’ is made up of 30-odd colleges. Each student, whether under- or post-graduate, is a member of a college first and foremost; accommodation, meals, and teaching vary depending on your college. While we do get lectures organised by the faculty/department, teaching is done primarily through the tutorial system, where a tutor (at least a PhD student, quite often post-docs or members of faculty) from your college meets you and one or two other students every week or so to discuss homework and go over content. The direct upshot of such a system is that your enjoyment and understanding of a subject are very closely tied to the specific tutors at your college.


## Expectations / Reasons for Applying

There’s no two ways about this: International fees are __incredibly__ expensive. With limited scholarships available for Australian undergraduates, the cost this year came to £36,000 (rising to £40,000+ next year!) for tuition alone. So there must have been many reasons which made me apply despite the substantial cost.

### Specialisation

Apart from Australian universities, I only applied to Oxford to read PPE. People would ask me “why did you not apply to the US?”. At the time, my answer was simple: I really wanted to do philosophy while maintaining employment flexibility through economics, and found politics very interesting. PPE was the perfect degree! Plus, I found liberal arts very unappealing, _having to_ do a variety of courses seemed to come at the expense of specialisation and rigour (slightly ironic coming from a PPEist, I know). I saw university as a time to dedicate oneself to a particular subject you loved and get really good at it; the academic attitude of Oxford aligned well with this vision.

I realised I wanted to do Philosophy as soon as I realised it was an actual subject and not just grifters bullshitting about ‘the meaning of life’ – it helped put names to the problems I had been wondering by myself (and getting stuck on and ultimately forgetting) for years, and reading the ingenious solutions put forward by genuinely smart people in history was equal parts satisfying and addicting. Furthermore, disappointing performances in the Australian Physics Olympiads left my motivation and mental health in poor shape; the humanities and essay writing just felt more interesting at the time. Before arriving at Oxford, I imagined I would like Economics the least – it seemed less technical and quantitatively unsophisticated compared to the sciences I was used to. I expected Politics to consist of political analysis of contemporary issues and debates, which I found particularly apt considering the backdrop of the ongoing War in Ukraine as well as 2024 being an election year. I expected Philosophy to be a sort of general overview of the evolution of human thought, going into a few interesting problems here and there, which was how I tended to read philosophy in my spare time anyway.

Finally, I had expected strong interlinking aspects of coursework between all three, as I saw PPE as occupying a very powerful intersection of three salient disciplines. In a world that rewards excellence and specialisation, being a generalist may not be the disadvantage as it _prima facie_ seems. The probability of success as a generalist: there being few people better than you _at all your skills simultaneously_[^1], is significantly higher than the analogous probability for a specialist: there being few people better than you _at your specialisation_. Of course, being Pareto-specialised is only as useful as there actually existing jobs that harness your particular combination of skills. But all three parts of PPE individually offer soft skills and knowledge that are broadly applicable, so in this regard, studying a combination of all three – ‘specialising in being a generalist’ – is very powerful.

### The People

My high school was one of the best in the country, and a huge proportion of each graduating class would be gunning for either medicine, law, or a combination of actuarial/computer science/commerce, mostly motivated by prestige, money, or a lack of other passions to follow. Apart from my group of friends and a handful of others, it felt like the majority of students simply weren’t curious nor had academic interests, which felt incredibly stifling. Seeing Oxford’s admission process put a particular emphasis on subject-related passion/skill/supercurricular involvement was a truly exciting prospect. In contrast, American universities like Harvard gave me the vibe of my high school, filled with career-oriented gunners whose desire for prestige outstripped a passion for knowledge. This, combined with my distaste for liberal arts, meant that I was not interested in going to an American university, despite what would have been much more affordable financial aid.

### Tutorials

Finally, I’ve always learnt **much** better in small classes. Throughout thirteen years of schooling, I struggled with focus and engagement in class even on my best days. I wasn’t interested in listening to other students ask questions that I had already figured out, but also didn’t want to ask questions of my own or contribute to discussions out of shyness. However, then I did Science and History Extension at my school, which had four and three students, respectively. I greatly enjoyed both; it was much more engaging – for once, I enjoyed discussions with my classmates and teachers. It was also easier to direct learning in interesting directions in small classes; combined with the fact that both were ‘extension’ courses, I enjoyed much more intellectual flexibility and found the sense of learning something simply for the sake of interestingness delightful. So to hear that the teaching at such an esteemed university was conducted in such a way sounded perfect.


## Reality

In retrospect, my expectations of course specialisation were too naïve, considering this was just first-year content. Prelim content was, sensibly, more focussed on getting students from a wide variety of backgrounds (many of whom, like me, had not formally studied any of the three in high school) to a satisfactory degree of procedural competence and disciplinary understanding. Admittedly I do prefer it this way though; I feel like I have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of all three subjects and can explain to the layperson why studying politics does not make me a politician, or why, despite studying economics, I can’t solve inflation or interest rates[^2]. Regardless, I feel well-prepared to learn harder content in FHS, and more importantly, confident in my ability to independently learn more content on all three if I ever wanted to.

On the whole, I’ve found the teaching to be a bit disappointing, if only because my expectations were so high. We did not have many tutorials one-to-two or one-to-one tutorials in true Oxford style; many had three or four students, and college ‘classes’ frequently had eight students or more. I have always been a pretty slow thinker, which meant my tutorial partners would often answer before me. This led me to either rush my thinking and blurt out superficial answers (these would come directly from the readings, with minimal synthesis required – normally I do not see the point in answering these), or just stay silent for big chunks of larger tutorials as I had to juggle between pushing on with my train of thought and keeping up with the conversation. I would almost inevitably fail the former as I get distracted by my tute partner and tutor’s voice, at which point I also would have zoned out and missed the beginning of the conversation. Some of my tute partners and tutors – especially my Theory of Politics tutor – would like to use both big words and talk at a fairly rapid pace, which, combined with my relative incompetence at the subject brewed a perfect storm of incomprehensibility. For some of my revision classes in Trinity, I was poorly prepared as I had been revising another subject / doing something else (read: rowing), which meant I could not follow what was going on. This was entirely my fault of course, and the notes I took down made sense when I revisited them when I started my revision of that subject, but the sense of general confusion and having to sit through a class rather than _participate_ in it which wasn’t great. Finally, some of my tutors were either just lazy/apathetic/disorganised/bad at teaching – more on this in [my subject breakdowns](#subject-by-subject) – which was disheartening.

<a name="people-reality"></a>
One area in which my expectations were not only not disappointed, but exceeded, was in the people I would meet and the conversations I would have. A common phrase in PPE is that we “do it for the people, not the degree”, which I initially found ridiculous but have come to accept over the year. I am extremely grateful to have met my group of friends, mostly the other PPEists at Merton, who, despite their different opinions, are all extremely intelligent and fun to talk to. From the discussions after lectures and tutorials, or in the library, to random conversations in the kitchen and Hall, being able to talk to my friends was what got me out of bed on many days. One indicator of a good conversation for me is that I walk away from it having changed the way I think about something, or having learned something new; I can easily say that I have had the privilege of enjoying _many_ of these mind-blowing conversations, almost every single day at Oxford. Plus, so many of my friends are incredibly driven and good at all sorts of random things, and that inspires me to actually get through my infinite bucket lists of learning new things. It’s just an amazing environment.

## Subject-by-subject

### Philosophy

Philosophy was a strange triplet of Moral Philosophy, General Philosophy, and Logic.

Moral focussed on Mill’s _Utilitarianism_, with a chunk of the course being a textual analysis and the other using it as a point of comparison with other moral systems. I was not particularly interested in Millian exegeses, even though the secondary reading by Roger Crisp was very good. We only had 4 tutorials and our tutor could not make one of them, but of the ones she did, they were 30 minute one-to-one sessions which were hugely enjoyable and were some of the best I got all year. We also got 30 minute one-to-one tutorials with a moral philosophy PhD student to discuss general writing style and some more content which I found very rewarding as well. We also had hour long classes which got a bit side tracked but our tutor was very knowledgeable so they were fun overall.
- I had not expected to enjoy moral as much as I did – I would say that as of writing this, I am quite strongly a utilitarian. I finally understand the meaning of ‘intellectual influences’ as biographers like to say – a term of studying and interrogating it, with a group of friends that already had a utilitarian lean
- The literature mainly presents a couple of classic arguments (e.g. the collapse objection against rule utilitarianism) and stock examples (e.g. choosing between the lives of Hadyn and an oyster to motivate higher and lower pleasures) that you can rely on for good marks in essays, though there remained scope for individual reinterpretation. One area I found the literature helpful was in unpicking the moral philosophical jargon (e.g. permissible vs obligatory), and setting out conceptual distinctions (e.g. multi-level act utilitarianism vs rule utilitarianism). A sense of _understanding_ greatly contributes to my enjoyment of a subject and I definitely got that in moral.
- While our tutor was disorganised at times (famously returning our mock exams one term late) I think their understanding of the material made up for it.

Genphil was closest to what I originally expected philosophy to be like;

- Logic
- General Philosophy

### Politics

Politics was split between Practice (political science) and Theory (political philosophy). We did 16 Practice of Politics lectures on various topics, of which we did 8 in tutorials. At Merton, our eight were evenly split between comparative government and political sociology. Theory of Politics lectures leant more towards a ‘history of political thought’ approach, with influential thinkers like Locke, Rousseau or Marx getting two lectures each. However, they also covered broader topics such as ‘free speech’ or ‘liberty’ near the end. Our Theory tutor was a Mill specialist, so our topics ended up centred on  _On Liberty_: the text itself, free speech, state paternalism, and democracy. While I’m not sure how other universities approach first-year politics, at Oxford, the ‘get the students up to speed’ paradigm rang true for politics as well.

- Practice of Politics
- Theory of Politics

### Economics

The most STEM-like of the three, the course structure of economics was also the most straightforward, delivered as a standard course of micro and macro with ‘probability and stats’ (a sound preparation for those going on to take quantitative papers) as dessert. All three parts, though especially micro, were more maths-heavy than expected, and the fusion of mathematical machinery with intuitive interpretation was reminiscent of Physics.

- Microeconomics
- Probability and Statistics
- Macroeconomics


## Experience of the past year

Rowing, extracurriculars


## Predictions going forward?

Now that I have this blog going, I can properly note down my expectations of FHS so when I finish that, I can come back to compare.

Predictions for fhs? Aesthetics seems lit

## I HAVE NOT FUKIN FINISHED WRITING YET BUT LUKE SENT OUT THE LINK SO COME BACK IN 2 DAYS TO READ TEH FINISHED PRODCUT

(or two weeks to see some more content..)
