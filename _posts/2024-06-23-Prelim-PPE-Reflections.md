Two days ago, I sat my last prelim exam and finished my first year of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Oxford. Right now is the most competent I will ever be at all 3, as I will not continue studying Politics in my second and third years. However, with the academic year seeming like quite literally _yesterday_, the wounds of exam week and three packed terms are still fresh. This means that while the technical points I’ve made about the course are likely to be accurate, an emotional reflection of the time will probably mellow out with some time. Maybe I’ll revisit this post in the future.

I’ve had ideas to write something along these lines for a while; but it was only once I saw that [my friend had published his own version](https://rohanselvaradov.netlify.app/ppe/), that I found the serious motivation to set up this website and finally write this. That’s something I’ve really appreciated about PPE: the incredible, genuinely inspiring coursemates.

Ultimately, this post is not a PPE essay, so I won’t formulaically weigh up positives and negatives to then shit out a dishonest ‘conclusion’ for the sake of arguing. Instead, I’ll first run through the course structure, recount my expectations when applying, reality check myself with a paper-by-paper review, a general coursework review, and finally reflect on whether I enjoyed my _time_ here, coursework or not.

## Course Structure
At Oxford, the academic year is split into three eight-week terms: Michaelmas (Oct-Dec), Hilary (Jan-Mar), and Trinity (Apr-Jun). PPE, like other Oxford undergraduate degrees, is a three-year course. The first year is called ‘Prelims’, where you study all three subjects. Most PPEists drop one of the three to focus on their other two subjects in their second and third years (called ‘FHS’, standing for ‘Final Honour School’).

Oxford and Cambridge are quite different to other universities in that administration is federated: ‘Oxford University’ is made up of 30-odd colleges. Each student, whether under- or post-graduate, is a member of a college first and foremost; accommodation, meals, and teaching vary depending on your college. Oxbridge teaching is done primarily via the tutorial system, where a tutor (at least a PhD student, quite often post-docs or members of faculty) from your college meets you every week or so to discuss homework and go over content.

While lectures were mostly given in Michaelmas and some of Hilary,



thoughts on ppe (subject breakdown, how i found tutorials, low participation in classes; need to rush my thinking; prelim difficulty)
What i thought i’d like, what i actually liked (reality of first year vs expectations)
Predictions for fhs? Aesthetics seems lit
