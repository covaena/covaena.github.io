The other day I was telling someone how "if I ever wrote a love poem it would turn out to be a comedy poem", which triggered my memory of this. After about 5 minutes of Google Docs rummaging, I found the rap battle (who the hell knows why??) me and my friend Daniel wrote for Year 9 English. If memory serves, we used [W2S' Diss Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmcfL_qLhMo) as our beat (and if you listen carefully, as the inspiration for some of our rhyme schemes). This was  one of the best 'presentations' I've ever been a part of, so I think surely deserves a spot on the blog.

- **bold** = **'Sit Down Romeo'** (me, Paris' POV)
- _italic_ = _'Paris Exposed'_ (Daniel, Romeo's response)


## Lyrics

**You can’t commit**

**(So) don’t say I got no girls … You hypocrite**

**You’re so pretentious, stop throwing fits**

**All of Verona knows, your lovelife is in the pits**

**You liked Rosaline ... but did she like you**

**No, when I asked her, she said wait who?**

<br/><br/>

_Yeah I showed my girl but where's yours_

_Oh thats right I'm the guy she prefers_

_Never been in a fight never seen someone so weak_

_Does a girl really want a guy that squeaks_

_Paris you're nothing compared to me_

_Just stop talking I beg I plee_

<br/><br/>

**I got the wealth, and the brains, where’s your degree**

**Whoops I forgot, your brain’s the size of a pea**

**You said I can’t rap … your lines are just so weak**

**I’m having trouble hearing you, just go and take a seat**

**If you think that you’re rich, you must be mad**

**All of your money, came from your own dad**

**Romeo you got banished, how did do that**

**Just scurry away, you slimy little rat**

<br/><br/>

_I’m not book smart I’m street smart what about you_

_Your a lil snake you belong in the zoo_

_Your a prime example of a one sided love_

_Your the kind of guy a girl would want to get rid of_

_At least I got the looks what about you_

_You look pretty wack you know it’s true_

_Is money the only thing that you got_

_Alright I’ll stop time to tie the love knot_

_Oh wait that’s right you got rejected_

_For me I’m the reason you got neglected_

<br/><br/>

**You said you were a good man, but I think that’s all crap**

**You jumped girls faster, than you learnt how to rap**

**You threw a temper tantrum, and guess what you did**

**That’s right you killed Tybalt, you moody little kid**

<br/><br/>

_Stop saying stuff about the age of my chick_

_It’s just I’m the one she actually chose to pick_

_You got rejected before she even met you_

_Guess she heard about that terrible view_

_Dont answer back it’s hard to follow_

_You cant spit fire all you do is you swallow_

<br/><br/>

**To Juliet’s parents, you haven’t showed your face**

**So talk to them first, you little disgrace**

**You’re a pathetic slug, shame on the Montagues**

**Your flow is worse, than a train wreck in glue**

**Little girls Romeo, you’re a better guy**

**Juliet’s 13, here comes the F.B.I.!**

_[Cue FBI open up and watch as the crowd goes nuts]_
